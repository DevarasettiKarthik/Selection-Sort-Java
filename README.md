# Selection Sort in Java

## Description
This program demonstrates the implementation of **Selection Sort** in Java.
Selection sort works by repeatedly selecting the **minimum or maximum element**
from the unsorted part of the array and placing it in its correct position.

## How It Works (Ascending Order)
- Finds the **smallest element** in the unsorted part
- Swaps it with the first unsorted position
- Repeats until the array is sorted in ascending order

---

## How It Works (Descending Order)
- Finds the **largest element** in the unsorted part
- Swaps it with the first unsorted position
- Repeats until the array is sorted in descending order

## Input Format
